#### This is a repository of work for a project in which corn production and sales for locations across the USA were examined for the years 2012 and 2022 in relation to the location's Plant Hardiness Zone. 

#### This was conducted with the purpose of determining if changes in climate- specifically, redesignations of the Plant Hardiness Zone which is calculated by lowest annual average temperature for a region- over the decade affected crop production in a meaningful way.
